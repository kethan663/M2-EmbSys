# Description
Smart Dustbin as its name represents it works smartly or we can say that it is an automatic dustbin. It works like when you will come in front of this dustbin it will open automatically with the help of a servo motor. So there is some sensor work to detect the object in front of the dustbin.
# Identifying Features
* It should open the lid of the dustbin whenever it senses the human hand.
* It should close the lid of the dustbin after a specified amount of time.
# State of Art
* The main focus point here is to have a dustbin which is smart enough.
* The dustbin should open and close itself automatically.
* As the world pace farward, the technology needs to catch up to the world.

# Requirements
## High level requirements
| ID  | High level requirements |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| HL1  |It should automatically open the lid when detect human|
| HL2  | The bin should automatically close the lid after specified amount of time|
## Low level requirements
| ID  | Low level requirements |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| H1L1  |It opens the lid of the dustbin according to the values of ultrasonic sensor.|
| H1L2  |According to the values the micro controller receives, it orders the rely to start motion.   |
| H2L1  | It closes the lid according to the timer or the delay we give during coding.|
